                Carly started baking cookies at the young age of 6 when she received an Easy Bake Oven as a birthday gift. She loved baking and soon after started 
                to bake full scale in kitchen oven. The very first flavor she created -- which is still today the bestselling flavor – was completely by accident when 
                her devious younger brothers tried to sabotage her batch of chocolate chip cookies by putting pineapple juice in the dough. Cookie Cache was founded in 
                2016 when the demand for Carly’s delicious cookies could no longer be met in her college dorm kitchen. Cookie Cache retail locations now serve customers in
                7 states including, Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, and Washington and serves customers nation-wide through web-orders!</th>
